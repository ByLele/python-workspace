  description: 'The Economist videos give authoritative insight and opinion on international
    news, politics, business, finance, science, technology and the connections between
    them.


    We''re also producing full films such as The Disrupters, an original series exploring
    how major industries—from music and cars to hospitality—are currently being disrupted
    by the latest wave of digital innovation. As well as enjoying privileged access
    into the world biggest tech start ups we show how industry giants respond when
    faced with such tech-driven innovation—do they adapt—or die?


    Subscribe to our channel to be among the first to see the new films in the series
    when we post them.'

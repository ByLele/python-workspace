  description: 'Greetings and welcome to my channel, where I tinker with technology
    in the comfort of my garage. As a retiree, I am eager to give back to the community
    and inspire others to experiment and learn for themselves. My goal is to make
    science and electronics accessible to everyone, regardless of their educational
    background. I strive to avoid using technical jargon or complex mathematical concepts
    in my videos, as I understand that not everyone has a science degree.

    While there are many YouTube channels that cater to the hardcore engineering crowd,
    my content is suitable for both newcomers and seasoned professionals in the field
    of electronics and engineering. I encourage everyone to follow in my footsteps,
    take action, and don''t be afraid to fail. Go do! Most importantly, have fun!

    My channel started with me fixing an old IMSAI 8080 computer, but now I cover
    a variety of topics. Once again, I extend a warm welcome to all of my viewers.
